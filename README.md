# Overview

This programming assignment will exercise your skills with a variety of
patterns.

The topics that you will cover in this assignment are:

  1. Visitor Pattern
  2. Interpreter Pattern

Tip: Commit and push to your repository frequently so that the instructor
can see your incremental work. Particularly for people that struggle 
with the assignment, lots of commits will show the effort that you put
in and raise your score. Also, 

Grading process:
   1. If you have a working implementation, you will receive a 100
   2. If you have a broken / incomplete implementation, code comments will
      be inserted into your work with suggestions on what to improve.
   3. If you receive comments, you will need to address the comments
      and commit the updated version within a week of receiving the
      comments.
   4. You may receive multiple rounds of comments.
   5. Once the final version is committed, you will be given a grade.
   
What to do:
   1. See the edu.vanderbilt.cs.live9.QueryEngine interface for instructions
   2. You will likely build off of your prior work. If you do so,
      you must fix any tests that break.
   3. When your implementation is complete, make sure the most up
      to date version is committed and pushed to your assignment
      repository.
   4. One of the hardest parts of this assignment is going to be 
      figuring out the requirements. Pay careful attention to the
      example in the QueryEngine.main() method. It generates an
      abstract syntax tree, prints it out for you, and then shows
      what a manually crafted FindExpression for that syntax tree
      would look like. It is your job to implement a visitor that
      can construct the FindExpressions automatically from an 
      arbitrary syntax tree.
      
Warning!! There may be typos, bugs, or other issues with the assignment.
If you encounter a bug, typo, etc., please post to the course discussion
forum to let the instructor know.
