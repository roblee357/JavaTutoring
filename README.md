# Overview

This programming assignment will exercise your skills with stream and
function programming.

The topics that you will cover in this assignment are:

  1. Java streams
  2. Functional programming
  3. Strategy Pattern
  4. Command Pattern
  

Tip: Commit and push to your repository frequently so that the instructor
can see your incremental work. Particularly for people that struggle 
with the assignment, lots of commits will show the effort that you put
in and raise your score. Also, 

Grading process:
   1. If you have a working implementation, you will receive a 100
   2. If you have a broken / incomplete implementation, code comments will
      be inserted into your work with suggestions on what to improve.
   3. If you receive comments, you will need to address the comments
      and commit the updated version within a week of receiving the
      comments.
   4. You may receive multiple rounds of comments.
   5. Once the final version is committed, you will be given a grade.
   
What to do:
   1. See the edu.vanderbilt.cs.live67ProximityStreamDB interface for instructions
   2. You will likely build off of your prior work. If you do so,
      you must fix any tests that break.
   3. When your implementation is complete, make sure the most up
      to date version is committed and pushed to your assignment
      repository.
      
Warning! There may be typos, bugs, or other issues with the assignment.
If you encounter a bug, typo, etc., please post to the course discussion
forum to let the instructor know.
